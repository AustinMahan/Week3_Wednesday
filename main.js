// More Function Exercises!

// 1. Write a function that prints out the entire "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" song lyrics.

// 2. Use a function to ask a user for a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit.

// 3. Adding to the code in #3, prompt the user a second time to determine whether they'd like to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius
//    or from Celsius to Fahrenheit. To keep it simple, instruct them to use "F to C" or "C to F".
//    Alert them with an error if they do not follow the rules.

// 4. Create a 'Guessing Game'. The game starts by picking a random number.
//    It then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user's number is lower/higher,
//    it will prompt the user to enter another guess and tell the user if the guess was
//    too high or too low. This continues until the correct guess is entered.
//    When the correct guess is entered the user is given a success message with the correct number.
